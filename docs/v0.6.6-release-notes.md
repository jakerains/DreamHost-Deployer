# DreamHost Deployer v0.6.6 Release Notes

## New Init Command

This release introduces a new `init` command that streamlines the setup process for deploying projects to DreamHost:

```bash
dreamhost-deployer init
```

### Features

- **Project Detection**: Automatically detects your project type (Vite, React, Next.js, etc.)
- **Configuration Creation**: Interactively creates a `deploy.config.json` file in your project directory
- **SSH Connection Testing**: Verifies SSH connection to your DreamHost server
- **Server Environment Check**: Tests if your server has the required Node.js and NVM setup
- **Guided Setup**: Prompts for any missing information and validates your configuration

### Benefits

- **Faster Setup**: Complete all setup steps through a single command
- **Fewer Steps**: No need to run multiple setup commands one after another
- **Local Configuration**: Configuration is saved to your project directory for future deployments
- **Framework Optimizations**: Automatically applies best settings based on your project type

### Usage

Run the command in your project directory:

```bash
dreamhost-deployer init
```

After completing the initialization, you can immediately deploy your project:

```bash
dreamhost-deployer deploy
```

## Updated Documentation

The quick start guide has been updated to reflect the simplified workflow with the new `init` command.
