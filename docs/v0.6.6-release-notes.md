# DreamHost Deployer v0.6.6 Release Notes

## Overview

This release focuses on fixing initialization issues and improving the user experience during project setup. The most significant updates include robust timeout handling for SSH connections and better differentiation between the init command and main menu.

## Key Improvements

### Fixed Init Command Hanging Issues

The init command has been completely reworked to prevent hanging during SSH connections and server environment checks:

- **Robust Timeout Handling**: Added explicit timeouts at multiple levels:
  - 15-second timeouts for individual SSH connection attempts
  - 30-second overall timeout for the entire SSH verification process
  - 45-second timeout for server environment checks

- **Improved Error Handling**:
  - Added detailed error messages that clearly indicate when connections time out
  - Properly clean up resources (like SSH connections) when timeouts occur
  - Better error recovery to continue initialization even when SSH checks fail

- **More Reliable SSH Connections**:
  - Added Promise.race() pattern to implement proper timeout handling
  - Improved resource management to prevent memory leaks
  - Added custom timeout promises to ensure operations never hang indefinitely

### Enhanced Init Command Workflow

The init command has been updated to more clearly differentiate itself from the default menu:

- **Improved Welcome Message**: Added a detailed welcome message that explains:
  - What the init command specifically does
  - How it's different from the interactive menu
  - The step-by-step process it will guide users through

- **Better Documentation**:
  - Updated command descriptions in CLI help text
  - Improved README.md documentation to clarify the init command's purpose
  - Enhanced project map with clearer command explanations
  - Added menu descriptions that better explain what each option does

## Features

- **Project Detection**: Automatically detects your project type (Vite, React, Next.js, etc.)
- **Configuration Creation**: Interactively creates a `deploy.config.json` file in your project directory
- **SSH Connection Testing**: Verifies SSH connection to your DreamHost server
- **Server Environment Check**: Tests if your server has the required Node.js and NVM setup
- **Guided Setup**: Prompts for any missing information and validates your configuration

## Usage

Run the command in your project directory:

```bash
dreamhost-deployer init
```

After completing the initialization, you can immediately deploy your project:

```bash
dreamhost-deployer deploy
```

## Upgrade Instructions

This is a recommended upgrade for all users, especially those experiencing hanging during the initialization process.

```bash
# Update to the latest version
