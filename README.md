## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

DreamHost Deployer uses a `deploy.config.json` file to store your deployment settings. You can create this file manually or use the interactive setup to generate it.

### Interactive Configuration

The easiest way to create your configuration is through the interactive setup:

```bash
dreamhost-deployer
```

This will launch a step-by-step wizard that guides you through:
1. Setting up your DreamHost server connection details
2. Configuring SSH authentication (password or key-based)
3. Specifying local and remote paths for deployment
4. Setting up build integration for your specific framework
5. Configuring exclusion patterns for files you don't want to deploy

### Sample Configuration

Here's a complete example of the `deploy.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "host": "example.dreamhost.com",
  "username": "your-username",
  "remotePath": "/home/your-username/example.com",
  "localPath": "./dist",
  "privateKeyPath": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
  "webServer": "apache",
  "buildIntegration": true,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "buildOutputDir": "dist",
  "excludePatterns": [
    "node_modules",
    ".git",
    ".env",
    ".DS_Store"
  ],
  "createBackup": true,
  "rollbackOnFailure": true,
  "deploymentMethod": "auto",
  "compressAssets": true,
  "timeout": 300000,
  "verboseLogging": false
}
```

### Configuration Options Explained

### Environment Variables

For CI/CD pipelines, you can use environment variables instead:

```
DREAMHOST_HOST=example.dreamhost.com
DREAMHOST_USERNAME=your-username
DREAMHOST_REMOTE_PATH=/home/your-username/example.com
DREAMHOST_LOCAL_PATH=./dist
DREAMHOST_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/id_rsa
DREAMHOST_WEB_SERVER=apache
DREAMHOST_BUILD_INTEGRATION=true
DREAMHOST_BUILD_COMMAND=npm run build
DREAMHOST_BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR=dist
DREAMHOST_EXCLUDE=node_modules,.git,.env,.DS_Store
DREAMHOST_CREATE_BACKUP=true
DREAMHOST_ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE=true
DREAMHOST_DEPLOYMENT_METHOD=auto
DREAMHOST_COMPRESS_ASSETS=true
DREAMHOST_TIMEOUT=300000
DREAMHOST_VERBOSE_LOGGING=false
```

You can mix and match environment variables and config file settings. Environment variables take precedence over the configuration file.

## üîë SSH Authentication Setup

Proper SSH authentication setup is crucial for secure and smooth deployments. DreamHost Deployer provides simple tools for setting up password-based authentication.

### Setting Up SSH Authentication

```bash
# Run the SSH setup wizard
dreamhost-deployer setup-ssh
```

This interactive wizard will:
1. Set up password authentication for your DreamHost server
2. Test the connection to verify it works
3. Provide an option to save your password for non-interactive deployments (not recommended for security reasons)
4. Guide you through fixing common connection issues

### SSH Authentication Best Practices

- **Use strong passwords** - Complex passwords provide better security
- **Don't save passwords in configuration files** - Enter your password during deployment instead
- **Consider a password manager** - Store your credentials securely
- **Update passwords regularly** - Change your DreamHost password periodically

## üèóÔ∏è Build Integration

DreamHost Deployer can automatically build your project before deployment, making it easy to deploy modern JavaScript frameworks.

### Automatic Framework Detection

The tool automatically identifies your project type by examining your dependencies and configuration files:

```bash
# Check what type of project was detected
dreamhost-deployer info
```

### Build Configuration

You can configure build settings through the interactive menu or by editing `deploy.config.json`:

```bash
# Configure build settings
dreamhost-deployer
# Select "Configure project settings"
```

### Build-Only Mode

You can run the build process without deploying to test it:

```bash
# Run build process only
dreamhost-deployer build
```

### Environment-Specific Builds

For different environments:

```bash
# Build with staging environment variables
dreamhost-deployer build --env staging

# Build with production environment variables
dreamhost-deployer build --env production
```

## üß© Framework Support

DreamHost Deployer automatically detects your project type and provides optimized settings:

| Framework | Detected Features | Build Command | Output Directory |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Vite      | Environment vars, asset handling | `npm run build` | `dist` |
| React (CRA) | Router settings, static optimization | `npm run build` | `build` |
| Next.js   | Static export, image optimization | `npm run build && npm run export` | `out` |
| Gatsby    | Asset prefixing, SEO optimization | `npm run build` | `public` |
| Vue CLI   | Router settings, compression | `npm run build` | `dist` |
| Nuxt.js   | Static generation, SSR detection | `npm run generate` | `dist` |
| SvelteKit | Adapter configuration | `npm run build` | `build` |

## üöÄ Detailed Deployment Process

DreamHost Deployer's deployment process is designed to be reliable, efficient, and safe.

### Deployment Workflow

When you run `dreamhost-deployer deploy`, the following steps occur:

1. **Configuration Loading**
   - Loads settings from `deploy.config.json` or environment variables
   - Validates all required settings are present

2. **Pre-Deployment Checks**
   - Verifies SSH connection to DreamHost
   - Checks for sufficient disk space on server
   - Validates all paths exist

3. **Build Process** (if enabled)
   - Runs your project's build command
   - Verifies build output exists
   - Prepares optimizations for your framework

4. **Backup Creation**
   - Creates a timestamped backup of your current site
   - Stores backup path for potential rollback

5. **File Transfer**
   - Uses rsync (if available) or SCP for optimal transfer
   - Excludes unnecessary files (node_modules, .git, etc.)
   - Shows progress bar during transfer

6. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Checks that all files were transferred correctly
   - Verifies file permissions on the server

### Deployment Methods

DreamHost Deployer supports multiple transfer methods:

**Rsync Method** (recommended)
- Faster due to differential transfers (only changed files)
- More efficient with large sites
- Better handling of permissions
- Requires rsync to be installed locally

**SCP Method** (fallback)
- Works on all platforms without additional software
- More reliable in some network environments
- Transfers entire files, even if only small changes made

### Rollback Capability

If something goes wrong during deployment, DreamHost Deployer can automatically roll back:

```bash
# Enable automatic rollback
dreamhost-deployer deploy --rollback

# Manual rollback to a specific backup
dreamhost-deployer rollback --backup /path/to/backup_2023-04-01
```

## üåê .htaccess Templates and Web Server Configuration

DreamHost Deployer includes pre-configured server settings for different application types.

### .htaccess Templates

The tool includes templates for:

```bash
# Generate an .htaccess file for a Single Page Application
dreamhost-deployer htaccess --type spa

# Generate an .htaccess file for a PHP application
dreamhost-deployer htaccess --type php

# Generate an .htaccess file for WordPress
dreamhost-deployer htaccess --type wordpress

# Generate an .htaccess file for a static site
dreamhost-deployer htaccess --type static
```

Each template includes:
- **URL Rewriting** - Proper rules for your application type
- **Caching Configuration** - Optimal cache headers for different file types
- **Compression Settings** - GZIP/Brotli compression for faster loading
- **Security Headers** - Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **Performance Optimizations** - Browser hinting, connection settings

### Sample SPA .htaccess
